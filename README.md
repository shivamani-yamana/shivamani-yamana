# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shivamani Yamana!

I’m that person who *needs* to know how things work — not just on the surface, but deep under the hood. Whether it's a blockchain consensus mechanism, a trading algorithm, or the realtime sync behind a multiplayer editor, I love digging into the guts of complex systems and building things that feel smooth, smart, and solid.

I’m currently studying Computer Science at IARE, Hyderabad (B.Tech, 2026), and spend most of my time somewhere between **frontend polish** and **backend logic** — or lost in the weeds of **blockchain tech**, **decentralized protocols**, and **fintech experiments**.

## 🚀 What I’m All About

My coding journey started with curiosity and hasn’t slowed since. I've worked with Web3 startups, explored frameworks like **SvelteKit**, and built everything from **real-time chess servers** to **collaborative editors** with conflict-free syncing.

Outside code, I dive deep into financial markets and crypto trends — and I freelance as a **video editor**, producing content for algorithmic trading companies. My projects live at the intersection of design, logic, and clarity — whether it’s a smart contract or a story-driven product video.
